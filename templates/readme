1. Dataset Explanation
For a churn prediction project, the dataset typically contains customer data where the goal is to predict if a customer will churn (i.e., cancel a service or stop using a product). Below is an example of a typical churn prediction dataset and its features.

Example Dataset Columns:
gender: The gender of the customer (Male/Female).

SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (1 if yes, 0 if no).

Partner: Whether the customer has a partner (1 if yes, 0 if no).

Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents (1 if yes, 0 if no).

tenure: The number of months the customer has been with the service.

PhoneService: Whether the customer has phone service (1 if yes, 0 if no).

MultipleLines: Whether the customer has multiple lines (1 if yes, 0 if no).

InternetService: The type of internet service (DSL, Fiber optic, or No service).

OnlineSecurity: Whether the customer has online security (1 if yes, 0 if no).

OnlineBackup: Whether the customer has online backup (1 if yes, 0 if no).

DeviceProtection: Whether the customer has device protection (1 if yes, 0 if no).

TechSupport: Whether the customer has tech support (1 if yes, 0 if no).

StreamingTV: Whether the customer has streaming TV service (1 if yes, 0 if no).

StreamingMovies: Whether the customer has streaming movies service (1 if yes, 0 if no).

Contract: The type of contract (Month-to-month, One year, or Two year).

PaperlessBilling: Whether the customer has paperless billing (1 if yes, 0 if no).

PaymentMethod: The customer's payment method (e.g., Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer, etc.).

MonthlyCharges: The monthly charge the customer pays.

TotalCharges: The total charges the customer has accumulated.

Churn: The target variable representing if the customer has churned (1 if yes, 0 if no).

2. Project Flow Overview
Here’s how the Churn Prediction project can be structured:

Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Load the data: Import the dataset using pandas and check for missing values or duplicates.

Data cleaning: Handle missing values (e.g., by filling or dropping them). Ensure that numerical features are correctly formatted and categorical features are properly encoded.

Feature Engineering: You might need to create new features, such as encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender, contract type) into numerical form using LabelEncoder or OneHotEncoder.

Step 2: Model Training
Split the data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. Usually, you use train_test_split to allocate around 70-80% of the data for training and 20-30% for testing.

Model Selection: Choose a machine learning model for the prediction task. For churn prediction, you can use models like:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

Training the model: Use the training dataset to train the chosen model. For example, with GradientBoostingClassifier, fit the model on the training set.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Step 3: Model Serialization
Once the model is trained and tuned for optimal performance, serialize the model using pickle so that it can be used for future predictions without retraining.


import pickle
pickle.dump(model, open('gradient_boosting_model.pkl', 'wb'))
Step 4: Creating the Flask Web Application
Now that you have the trained model, create a Flask web application that accepts user input (from a form), uses the model to predict whether the customer will churn, and returns the prediction.

Flask Application Flow:

Home Route (/): This route renders the input form (index.html) where users enter their details.

Predict Route (/predict): This route receives the form data (via POST method), prepares it for prediction, and uses the trained model to predict churn.

Result Route: After the prediction is made, show the result to the user (whether the customer will churn or not).


Step 6: Deployment
Test the application locally: Make sure the app works by running it locally and testing various inputs.

Deploy the Flask app: You can deploy the Flask application on cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS, or any other platform that supports Python web applications.
